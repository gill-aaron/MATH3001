A comparison of the error propagation of the modified Euler and RK4 methods at a large choice of step size. Observe that the RK4 method spirals inward but the modified Euler rotates and eventually returns to the original point. Note that the timestep used for the RK4 method is not adjusted for the computational cost of the method, giving a large advantage to the RK4 method.
